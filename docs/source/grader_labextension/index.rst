Grader Labextension
####################


The JupyterLab extension consists of two launchers for students and instructors/tutors.

Course Management
-----------------

The `Course Management` view for instructors and tutors provides functionality to create and manage assignments in lectures.
The whole lifecycle of the assignment is managed in this view, including the grading procedure.

Assignment
-----------

Students can view their assignments in the `Assignment` view and after working on the assignment they can make a submission
which will become visible in the `Submissions` tab in the `Course Management` view.
